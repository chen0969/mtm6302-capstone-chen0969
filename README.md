## Report -- My personal review (part-3)
	As an SCSS enthusiast, I’ve come to appreciate the differences between CSS and SCSS once again in this project. Since I was trained to follow the BEM class naming system, which fits well with SCSS, I realize that CSS code requires better structure and consideration during development.
