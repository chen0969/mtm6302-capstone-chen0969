## Report -- My personal review (part-3)
	As an SCSS enthusiast, I’ve come to appreciate the differences between CSS and SCSS once again in this project. Since I was trained to follow the BEM class naming system, which fits well with SCSS, I realize that CSS code requires better structure and consideration during development.

## Overall Report
"Poke panel" is a pokemon catch little made by Jing-An Chen with the assistence of the APIs and languages upon. Poke panel used many classic JavaScript classic functions such as addEventListener function and getElementById function to target the btns and main items to create those gamification interaction.

Because this assignment is the whole samester project, I actually met many interesting challenges I usually won't face with, for example, I am a <onclick=""> function lover, when I been tiold that I can't use this function in Poke panel I was actually in a huge shock, that means I need to rewrite many part of the fetch and btn functions, but I also understand that's how development works, when you find out a new requirement, just fix it.

Overall, this is a interesting project, and I also tried my best to make this project can be fun to play with, not just a school assignment, hope you like it!

P.S. I fix the project pdf, hope this time meet the requirement!
